### Hi there,

I'm a Research Scientist at [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/). I obtained my CS Ph.D. at Stony Brook University.

My research interests are **Robot Learning** and **Computer Vision** ðŸ¤–

Have fun to see my projects below, [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gMvLIDUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [personal website](https://elicassion.github.io/) for more details.

*I am always hungry, both physically ðŸ¥˜ and intellectually ðŸ’¡. [My cooking](https://elicassion.github.io/cooking/cooking.html)*
